### keypoint_classification.ipynb
This is a model training script for hand sign recognition.

### point_history_classification.ipynb
This is a model training script for finger gesture recognition.

### model/keypoint_classifier
This directory stores files related to hand sign recognition.<br>
The following files are stored.
* Training data(keypoint.csv)
* Trained model(keypoint_classifier.tflite)
* Label data(keypoint_classifier_label.csv)
* Inference module(keypoint_classifier.py)

### utils/cvfpscalc.py
This is a module for FPS measurement.

# Training
Hand sign recognition and finger gesture recognition can add and change training data and retrain the model.

### Hand sign recognition training

#### Model training
Open "[keypoint_classification.ipynb](keypoint_classification.ipynb)" in Jupyter Notebook and execute from top to bottom.<br>
To change the number of training data classes, change the value of "NUM_CLASSES = 3" <br>and modify the label of "model/keypoint_classifier/keypoint_classifier_label.csv" as appropriate.<br><br>

#### X.Model structure
The image of the model prepared in "[keypoint_classification.ipynb](keypoint_classification.ipynb)" is as follows.
